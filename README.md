# Jolly 2 PSP
## ... is a fan-made port of Jolly 2 (FNaF fan-game) to PSP.
____
# Description
A port of the original fan-game Jolly 2, made by IvanG. The gameplay is **almost** the same as the **PC** version.
____
# Usage
The source code is the game itself *(as long as it contains EBOOT.PBP in it)*! **Just download it and enjoy the game :)**
**However, the dev-build offers you an uncleaned version with the debug mode turned on.** I recommend you to wait until the oficial reease of the version.
____
# Modding
**Currenty there isn't any official way to mod the port, but you can do that if you want to.** Just some English basics, ability to read the code and Lua knowledge should be enough.

# Credits
## IvanG (the original creator) and the devs of the official game.
